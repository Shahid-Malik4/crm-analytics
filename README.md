# Background
Objective: To analyze sales data comprehensively by combining SQL Server data, performing data transformations in MySQL, cleaning in Excel, and visualizing insights in Power BI, focusing on best selling items, top paying customers, sales by company, category, territory, and time series analysis.


### The questions I wanted to answer:

1. How do sales vary across different regions or territories?
2. Which products or categories contribute the most to overall sales revenue?
3. How do different customer segments behave? (e.g., new vs. returning customers, high-value vs. low-value customers)
4. What is the distribution of revenue and profit margins among different companies?
5. How have sales revenues evolved for different companies and customer segments over the years?


# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the analysis, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **PowerBI:** My go-to for analysis and visualization.
- **Excel:** The handy tool for Data manipulation.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# What I Learned

Throughout this adventure, I've turbocharged my SQL toolkit with some serious firepower:

- **ðŸ§© Complex Query Crafting:** Mastered the art of advanced SQL, merging tables like a pro and wielding clauses for ninja-level table maneuvers.
- **ðŸ“Š Data Aggregation:** Got cozy with GROUP BY and turned aggregate functions like COUNT(), ROW_NUMBER(), RANK() and AVG() into my data-summarizing sidekicks.
- **ðŸ’¡ Analytical Wizardry:** Leveled up my real-world puzzle-solving skills, turning questions into actionable, insightful results.

# Conclusions

The "Boosting Profitability: Optimizing Sales via CRM and Analytics" project effectively utilized data extraction from SQL Server, manipulation in MySQL, cleaning in Excel, and visualization in Power BI to derive actionable insights and KPIs from sales data.
