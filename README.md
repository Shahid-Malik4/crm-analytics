# Introduction
ðŸ“Š The "Boosting Profitability: Optimizing Sales via CRM and Analytics" project involved the extraction, manipulation, and analysis of sales data sourced from SQL Server. Utilizing MySQL for data transformation, Excel for cleaning and preparation, and Power BI for normalization and visualization, the project aimed to derive actionable insights and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for sales analysis.

# Background
Objective: To explore and visualize extensive Olympic Games data to identify trends, top-performing countries, athletes, and gender distribution across various Olympic events and seasons.


### The questions I wanted to answer:

1. Distribution of medals among male and female athletes?
2. What countries participated in almost every Olympic Season?
3. Participants and Events by Season?
4. Medals distribution by Athletes, Countries and Sports throughout the Year's?
5. Athletes Participations and Medal Winning Analysis?


# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the analysis, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **PowerBI:** My go-to for analysis and visualization.
- **Excel:** The handy tool for Data manipulation.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

### 1. Distribution of medals among male and female athletes
- Across the 120 years analyzed, a total of 28530 medals were awarded to male athletes, while female athletes accumulated 11253 medals.
- In the early years of the Olympics, male athletes dominated the medal standings, with a significant gap between male and female medal counts.
- However, as the Olympics progressed, female representation and performance witnessed a steady rise, leading to a more balanced distribution of medals in recent years.


### 2. Countries participated in almost every Olympic Season
- Certain nations have consistently demonstrated a high level of engagement with the Olympic Games, appearing frequently across various editions.
- Countries such as the United States, Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), Germany, Great Britain, and France consistently rank among the top participants in terms of sheer number of appearances.
- External events such as wars, political conflicts, and economic crises have occasionally disrupted Olympic participation for certain countries, leading to fluctuations in their engagement over time.


### 3. Participants and Events by Season?

- **Summer Games:**
   - The Summer Olympics typically attract a larger number of participating countries and events compared to the Winter Games.
   - In total 230 countries participated in 29 editions and 116780 athletes played 52 sports won nearly 34000 medals.
   - Nations from around the world converge to compete in a wide array of sports, including athletics, swimming, gymnastics, and team sports like soccer and basketball.
   - The Summer Games traditionally feature a diverse range of events, reflecting the global appeal and popularity of warm-weather sports.

- **Winter Games:**
    - The Winter Olympics, held in colder climates, tend to have fewer participating countries and events compared to the Summer Games.
    - In total 119 countries participated in 22 editions and 18960 athletes played 17 sports won nearly 5695 medals.
    - Winter sports such as skiing, skating, snowboarding, and ice hockey dominate the program, with fewer nations possessing the infrastructure and expertise to compete in 
     these disciplines.
    - Despite the smaller scale, the Winter Olympics showcase the skill and athleticism of athletes in sports uniquely suited to snowy and icy conditions.


### 4. Medals distribution by Athletes, Countries and Sports throughout the Year's

- Certain athletes such as (Michael Fred Phelps II from US, Larisa Semyonovna Latynina from Soviet Union, Nikolai Yefimovich Andrianov from Russia) emerge as prolific medal winners, achieving multiple podium finishes across multiple Olympic Games.
- Traditional powerhouse sports such as athletics, swimming, and gymnastics often command a significant share of Olympic medals, reflecting their widespread appeal and global participation.
- Certain nations consistently rank among the top medal-winning countries, demonstrating sustained success and investment in Olympic sports.


### 5. Athletes Participations and Medal Winning Analysis

- In the span of 120 years, the United States has emerged as the most successful nation in terms of total medals won, with over 5600 medals across all editions of the Olympics. Russia (including the Soviet Union) follows closely behind, with over 3900 medals.
- Nations such as the United States, Russia, China, and Germany tend to excel across a wide range of Olympic disciplines, accumulating significant medal counts over successive Games.
- Countries with robust sports development programs and funding mechanisms often produce elite athletes capable of competing at the highest levels of Olympic competition.
- Historical legacies and geopolitical factors also play a role. For instance, countries with strong traditions in specific sports, such as Norway in winter sports and Kenya in distance running, often excel in those disciplines.

# What I Learned

Throughout this adventure, I've turbocharged my SQL toolkit with some serious firepower:

- **ðŸ§© Complex Query Crafting:** Mastered the art of advanced SQL, merging tables like a pro and wielding clauses for ninja-level table maneuvers.
- **ðŸ“Š Data Aggregation:** Got cozy with GROUP BY and turned aggregate functions like COUNT() and AVG() into my data-summarizing sidekicks.
- **ðŸ’¡ Analytical Wizardry:** Leveled up my real-world puzzle-solving skills, turning questions into actionable, insightful results.

# Conclusions

The "120 Years of Olympic Games: A Comprehensive Review" project successfully transformed raw Olympic Games data into a visually engaging and informative dashboard using Power BI. By leveraging data cleaning, normalization, and visualization techniques, the project provided stakeholders with a comprehensive tool to explore and understand historical trends, top performers, and key factors influencing the Olympic Games over more than a century.
